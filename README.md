## Problem Domain
The Rose City Resource Guide, published by Street Roots, is a comprehensive list of social services offered in Portland and is printed twice per year. Currently, it only exists in printed format. That printed format is only in English and unsortable as it is a booklet.

## A description of the project: 
This app makes the Rose City Resource guide more accessible by digitizing it which would decrease barriers to use for non-English speakers as well as folks with visual disabilities. Users are able choose which type of resource they are looking for and then are further able to sort based on neighborhood. Additionally, users have the option to save most used resources to their own personal list of frequently used services. The app offers a static map of public bathroom resources.

### 1.0.0 - Wed. Morning MVP reached
